# My DSA Journey üöÄ

Welcome to my personal Data Structures and Algorithms journal! This repository is my dedicated space to track progress, document learnings, and solidify my understanding of core computer science concepts.

The goal is not just to solve problems, but to understand the underlying patterns and build a strong foundation for technical interviews and beyond.

---

## üéØ My Goals

- [ ] Master all common data structures and their applications.
- [ ] Develop strong algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills.
- [ ] Solve at least 200 problems on platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank.
- [ ] Get comfortable with explaining my thought process clearly and concisely.
- [ ] Build the confidence to ace technical interviews.

## üìä Quick Stats

Here are some cool shields to track progress automatically (you'll need to configure them).

## üóìÔ∏è Daily Journal Log

A place for daily thoughts, summaries of concepts learned, or reflections on difficult problems. I'll create separate files for detailed notes in a `/notes` directory.

### 2025-09-25
* **Topic:** Hash Tables.
* **Learnings:** Reviewed the core concepts of hash functions and collision resolution. Implemented a simple hash table from scratch.
* **Problem Solved:** LeetCode "Two Sum". The brute-force approach is $O(n^2)$, but using a hash map to store seen numbers and their indices optimizes it to a single pass, making it $O(n)$ time complexity. Space complexity becomes $O(n)$ for the map.
